    decompressed_json = zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(json_response["compress_annotations"])).decode()
```

## LAUNCH:
To Start your container use:
```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
go to http://localhost:8000/docs to try the API Endpoint

### Connect to the FastAPI container
```sh
$ docker ps
```
It will return something in the form of:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
83a64e13ae7c   task-backend-xfarm-fastapi   "uvicorn app.main:apâ€¦"   9 minutes ago   Up 9 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp   task-backend-xfarm-fastapi-1

To have shell access to the container :
```sh
$ docker exec -it 83a64e13ae7c bash
```
### Testing.
